- Take a vetting process of the freelancers: they will conduct an initial profile review on the applicants' skill sets, experience, etc. Then the freelancers will need to take a mandatory testing for their English-language proficiency and industry-standard skill sets to validate their expertise and level. Only upon passing will they proceed to be reviewed by a subject-matter expert who ultimately decide their fit for a role and experience level. Those who successfully pass the vetting will be invited to an onboarding session where they review a new talent manual, hear from seasoned talents, and understand expectations and standards of the community.
